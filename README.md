# `~tails` üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

**A scripting language for everyone**

Tails prioritizes **readability** and **simplicity** above all else. 

With simple `~variable` notation, english-like syntax, and powerful built-ins for modern tasks like HTTP requests and data processing, Tails makes scripts that anyone can understand.

### Made for Humans

**New to scripting?** Tails is intuitive and readable - anyone can start coding in 30 seconds! 

**Experienced developer?** Tails won't get in your way. Write simple automation scripts without fighting the language.

### Key Features

- **üîñ Readable Variables** with `~` prefix notation
- **üéØ String Interpolation** that just works
- **üåê Built-in HTTP Operations** for modern tasks
- **‚ö° Compose Functionality** with actions
- **üì¶ Rich Objects** with intuitive property access
- **üîÑ Intuitive Control Flow** that makes sense

## üöÄ See It In Action

### HTTP & Data Processing
```tails
~user is get "https://api.github.com/users/octocat"
say "Found user: `~user.name` with `~user.public_repos` repos"
```

### Actions (aka Functions)
```tails
action greet-user ~name ~age (
    if ~age >= 18 (
        say "Welcome `~name`! You can access all features."
    ) else (
        say "Hi `~name`! Parental guidance recommended."
    )
)

*greet-user "Alice" 25
```

### Interactive Automation
```tails
loop (
    ~username is ask "GitHub username (or 'quit'): "
    if ~username == "quit" break-loop

    ~info is get "https://api.github.com/users/`~username`"
    say "`~info.name` has `~info.public_repos` public repositories"
)
```

## Development

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tj-mc/tails.git
cd tails
cargo build --release
./target/release/tails
```

### Run Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

### Web REPL Development

**One-command setup:**
```bash
./web-dev.sh    # Installs dependencies, builds WASM, starts server
```

**Manual steps:**
```bash
./build-web.sh  # Build WebAssembly package
./serve-web.sh  # Start development server
```

See [web/README.md](web/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Create Release Builds
```bash
./tools/build_release.sh
```

### Project Structure
- `src/lexer.rs` - Tokenizes input
- `src/parser.rs` - Builds syntax tree
- `src/evaluator.rs` - Executes code
- `src/ast.rs` - Data structures
- `src/value.rs` - Runtime values

## Performance Testing

For comprehensive performance testing, benchmarking, and profiling documentation, see:

üìä **[PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md)**

### Quick Performance Commands:
```bash
# Compare Tails vs Bun performance
cd benchmark_comparison && ./run_benchmarks.sh

# Identify bottlenecks (lexing vs parsing vs evaluation)
cargo run --bin performance_main your_program.tails

# Track performance over time
./tools/production_benchmarks.sh
```
