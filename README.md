# ðŸ“¦ Archived: Tails â†’ Tilde

**This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained.**

## ðŸš€ **New Location**

The project has been rebranded to **Tilde** and moved to:

**https://github.com/tj-mc/tilde**

## Why the Change?

The original "Tails" name conflicted with:
- Tails OS (privacy-focused Linux distribution)
- Various other programming tools and projects
- SEO discovery challenges

**Tilde** better reflects the language's core `~` syntax and provides a unique, searchable identity.

## What Changed?

- **Name**: Tails â†’ Tilde
- **File extensions**: `.tails` â†’ `.tilde`
- **Package name**: `tails` â†’ `tilde`
- **CLI command**: `tails` â†’ `tilde`

All functional programming features, performance optimizations, and core language design remain identical.

## Migration Guide

If you were using Tails:

1. **Download the latest Tilde release**: https://github.com/tj-mc/tilde/releases
2. **Rename your files**: Change `.tails` extensions to `.tilde`
3. **Update your scripts**: Replace `tails` command with `tilde`

No code changes needed - the language syntax is identical!
